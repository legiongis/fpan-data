This is a tricky process, because 1. installing Shapely on Windows is tricky and 2. installing new modules into the Python installation that ArcGIS uses can also be tricky. Hopefully the following steps will help you along:

- Download the appropriate .whl from here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely. You should get "Shapely‑1.5.17‑cp27‑cp27m‑win32.whl" because it is Python 2.7 and 32-bit and those things match ArcGIS's python installation. I don't think the version 1.5 or 1.6 matters. Put this file somewhere easy to find.
- Open ArcMap and in the python interpreter run
	import os
	print os.sys.path
- Find the path closest to the beginning of the list that contains python.exe. For me it was
	C:\\Python27Arc\\ArcGIS10.4
- Open up a command prompt and use a command that 1. explicitly runs python from the path above to 2. upgrade pip in that installation. For me it was
	\Python27Arc\ArcGIS10.4\python \Python27Arc\ArcGIS10.4\Scripts\pip.exe install --upgrade pip
- Now that pip has been upgraded (for me from 7.0.1 to 9.0.1), use the same strategy to pip install Shapely into this Python environment. For me it was
	\Python27Arc\ArcGIS10.4\python \Python27Arc\ArcGIS10.4\Scripts\pip.exe install \Users\LEGION-GIS\Downloads\Shapely-1.5.17-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl
- That should do it. Now, in the ArcMap Python interpreter, try
	import shapely
  if you get an import error, you'll need to try this all again...
